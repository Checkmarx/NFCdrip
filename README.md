# NFCdrip

Our security research team developed an Android application to implement NFC data exfiltration method using the native Android API. The research demonstrates successful data exfiltration at 20 meters and signal detection at over 35 meters using the NFC radio of a Samsung S8 Android device. All tests use a cheap, standard radio as a receiver, connected via the mic jack to a smartphone that decodes the data.
